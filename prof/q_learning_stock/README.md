# FYP_Reinforcement_Learning

## Note
1. data_generation.py is to generate stock data. Need to have api key in config/keys.json
2. GA is done by using ga_main.py to generate parameters, then manually copy paste (not much time for better) to util/algo_dataset.py (in get_algo_results).
3. train_rl7.py does not use the LSTM model. train_rl8.py uses the model. To generate jsut run lstm_pred.py

## Environment
Code tested in python 3.7.3 64-bit, in ubuntu 18.0.4
